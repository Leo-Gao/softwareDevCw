to run the code, just use the default python code to run a program.

$> python dbc.py

at the begining stage, people will ask to choose something,  whether people would like to play the game given the option y/N and what kind of opponent they want to play with.

by default, if people do not type anything instead just press the enter button, then th program wil regard at the entter input as the default value. that way, for a very skilled player, they dont neet waste time on it.
